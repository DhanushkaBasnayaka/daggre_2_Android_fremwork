# My project's README
Dagger 2 is dependency injection framework. It is based on the Java Specification Request (JSR) 330. It uses code generation and is based on annotations. The generated code is very relatively easy to read and debug.  Dagger 2 uses the following annotations:  @Module and @Provides: define classes and methods which provide dependencies  @Inject: request dependencies. Can be used on a constructor, a field, or a method  @Component: enable selected modules and used for performing dependency injection  Dagger 2 uses generated code to access the fields and not reflection. Therefore it is not allowed to use private fields for field injection.
